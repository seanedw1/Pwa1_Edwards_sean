/*******************************************
 STUDENT ACTIVITY 1 (REVIEW)
 We are starting the review with an assessment to test your comprehension of
 some of the course materials from Goal 2

     1.  an array of students is provided for you
     2.  console.log the number of items in the array
     3.  create a for loop
         - console.log the index number
         - console.log the student name in the array that pertains to the index
             number of the loop (i.e. if the loop is on index 1 then the student's
             name of 'Bob' should be console.logged
 ********************************************/

// Array - For Loop
    var students1 = ['Bob','Christine','Sally','Jim'];

	===================================================================
	Scope & Context

	- scope controls the visibility and lifetime of variables and parameters 
		- it defines where the variable is created, & where it can be accessed
	
	- javascript uses lexical scoping
		1.  a “scope level” will check parent levels for variables, and
		2.  a new “scope level” in javascript can only be made with a function

	- if a variable doesn’t exist in the current scope, through lexical scoping
		it will try to find the variable in a parent block	
		
	- local variables override higher scoped variables
	
	
	- all variables defined in a code block using {...} are not visible from 
		outside of the block - the code block is normally defined in a function
	-	variables defined in the code block are released when execution of the 
		block is finished
	- 	each function has it's own scope	

		var globalVar = “jamesBond”;
		function functionName(){
            var localVar = “maryBond”;   //only available within the function
			//you can use globalVar in this function
		}                
 			//you can use globalVar outside of the function


	- the 1st num is a global variable & will live for the life of the program
  	- the 2nd num is a local variable & will last only as long as the function
		
		var num = 1;       //this is the 1st num                 

		function myCounter ( ) {
			var num = 50;  //this is the 2nd num                            
		};


	More Examples:
	function functionName(var1){
		//you can use var1 in this function
	}                
		//you cannot use var1 after the function	


	function functionName(){
		var localVar = “jameBond”;
			//you can use localVar in this function
		}                
			//you cannot use localVar after the function

	function functionName(){
		shouldBeLocalVar = “jamesBond”;

			//without the var, this is actually a Global variable!
			//you can use shouldBeLocalVar in this function
	}                
		//you can use shouldBeLocalVar outside of the function

	Closure

	- Whenever you see the function keyword within another function, the inner function 
		has access to variables of the outer function.
*/


		////////////// EXAMPLE 2 //////////////////
		
    console.log("---------- Closure ----------------");



    var FName="james";

    var nameFN = function(var1){

        var firstName = var1;
        var lastName = "bond";
        var name = firstName +" " +lastName;

        console.log("inside function: ", name);

        //closure function
        var closureFN = function(){

            console.log(firstName+" "+lastName);
        };
        return closureFN;
    };

    var fullName = nameFN(FName);

    console.log("outside function: ",fullName);

    //console.log(firstName);
    //console.log(lastName);

fullName();




    /*
    Definition:  Closure:
          1.  a snapshot of the functions outer environment at the time the closure is
              created
          2.  a closure is created at the moment when you assign a function
              reference and a copy of it's environment into memory by putting
              it inside of a variable, like we have done with the "fullName" variable

              -  so we have taken a snap shot of the function "closureFN"
              -  as well as any data ("firstName", "lastName", and "name") that was
                  available to it at the time we was created our closure or "snapshot"
                  "var fullName = nameFN(fname);"  including any fn parameters

         3.  so closure is a special type of object that combines a function and
              "the environment" in which that function was created.

              - "the environment" consist of any fn input parameters that are passed
                  to the "closureFN" function and variables at the time the closure
                  was created (the 3 variables inside of nameFN.

          4.  another way to look at this is that you are binding some information
                 to a variable so you can use it later " fullName();" , in your application

          5.  NOTE:  a function doesn't have to return something in order to be
                  called a closure.  Simply accessing variables outside of its
                  immediate lexical scope creates a closure.
